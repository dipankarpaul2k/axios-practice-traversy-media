# Axios Tutorial Practice

> I followed the tutorial of Traversy Media - Axios Crash Course | HTTP Library. You can find the boilerplate code in his github repo.

Axios is a popular JavaScript library that is used for making HTTP requests from a web browser or Node.js. It is commonly used for sending asynchronous HTTP requests to REST APIs and receiving responses. Axios is designed to work with Promises and provides a more convenient and concise way to perform HTTP requests compared to traditional XMLHttpRequest.

Axios provides a consistent and easy-to-use API for handling request and response data, including support for request and response interceptors, request and response configuration, and much more.
